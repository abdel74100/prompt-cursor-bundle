You are an expert software architect and project planner. I will provide you with a project idea, and you will generate ALL the necessary project documentation files in a single conversation.

# Project Idea

{{IDEA}}

# Your Task

Generate the following files in order, ensuring consistency and quality across all documents. Each file should be complete, professional, and ready to use.

## File 1: project-request.md

**IMPORTANT: Save this file as `.promptcore/docs/project-request.md`**

Create a comprehensive project request document that includes:

- Project overview and objectives
- Target users/audience
- Key features and functionalities (detailed list)
- Success criteria
- Technical constraints or requirements

Format: Professional markdown with clear sections.

---

## File 2: cursor-rules.md  

**IMPORTANT: Save this file as `.promptcore/docs/cursor-rules.md`**
(Note: It will be automatically copied to `.cursorrules` at the root)

Create Cursor AI rules for this project including:

- Technology stack (frameworks, libraries, versions)
- Code structure and organization
- Naming conventions (files, variables, functions, components)
- Best practices and patterns to follow
- Code style guidelines
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards

Format: Clear, actionable rules that Cursor AI can follow.

---

## File 3: spec.md

**IMPORTANT: Save this file as `.promptcore/docs/spec.md`**

Create detailed technical specifications including:

- System architecture (components, services, data flow)
- Database schema (tables, relationships, fields)
- API endpoints (routes, methods, request/response formats)
- Authentication and authorization strategy
- Real-time features (if applicable)
- External integrations (APIs, services)
- Security considerations
- Performance requirements
- Scalability considerations

Format: Technical markdown with code examples and diagrams where helpful.

## File 4: implementation-plan.md

**IMPORTANT: Save this file as `.promptcore/docs/implementation-plan.md`**

Create a detailed implementation plan with:

- Phases of development (logical grouping)
- Steps in each phase (specific, actionable)
- For each step:
  - Step number and title
  - Detailed tasks (what to do)
  - Files to create/modify
  - Dependencies on other steps
  - User instructions (commands to run)
- Risks and mitigation strategies

Format: Use this structure for each step:

```markdown
### Step X: [Title]
- **Task**: [What needs to be done]
- **Files**: 
  - `file1.js`: [Purpose]
  - `file2.js`: [Purpose]
- **Step Dependencies**: [Which steps must be completed first]
- **User Instructions**: 
  - [Specific commands or actions]
```

---

# Important Instructions

1. **Be comprehensive**: Each file should be complete and production-ready
2. **Be consistent**: Technology choices should align across all files
3. **Be specific**: No vague descriptions like "set up the database" - provide exact schemas, commands, etc.
4. **Be practical**: Include realistic timelines and dependencies
5. **Generate ALL files**: Provide complete content for each file, not summaries

# Output Format

For each file, use this format:

```
=== FILE: filename ===

[Complete file content here]

=== END FILE ===
```

This allows easy extraction of each file.

# Start Generating

Based on the project idea above, generate all 4 files now. Be thorough and professional.
