# 🤖 AI Agent System - Project Generation

You are an expert software architect and AI system designer. Your task is to analyze a project idea and generate comprehensive documentation with agent-based development workflow.

## 📥 PROJECT IDEA

{{IDEA}}

---

# Your Task

Based on the project idea above, generate **5 MARKDOWN FILES**:

## 📄 File 1: `project-request.md`
Transform the raw idea into a structured project request:
- Clear project title
- Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
- Business objectives
- Target users
- Key features list
- Success metrics
- Constraints and limitations

## 📄 File 2: `ai-rules.md`
Define AI-specific coding rules for this project. Include:
- Code style and conventions
- File naming patterns
- Architecture patterns to follow
- Security requirements
- Performance guidelines
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Agent-specific instructions (each agent should follow these base rules)

## 📄 File 3: `spec.md`
Create detailed technical specifications:
- System architecture overview
- Component breakdown
- Data models / schemas
- API endpoints (if applicable)
- Authentication flow
- Third-party integrations
- Technology stack with versions
- **Agent responsibilities** (which agent handles which component)

## 📄 File 4: `implementation-plan.md`
Generate a step-by-step implementation plan:
- Each step should have:
  - Clear title
  - Objective
  - **Agent assignment** (e.g., `Agent: backend`, `Agent: frontend`)
  - Specific tasks with checkboxes
  - Estimated time
  - Dependencies (e.g., `Depends on: Step 1`)
  - Success criteria

Format example:
```
## Step 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
**Agent:** devops
**Objective:** Initialize project structure and core dependencies
**Depends on:** none
**Estimated:** 2 hours

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create monorepo structure
- [ ] Configure TypeScript
- [ ] Set up Docker environment
- [ ] Initialize CI/CD pipeline

### Success Criteria:
- Project builds successfully
- Docker containers run
```

## 📄 File 5: `agents.json`
Define the agents required for this project:
```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "backend",
      "name": "Backend Agent",
      "rules": ".prompt-rules/backend-rules.md",
      "description": "Implements APIs, DB, business logic."
    },
    {
      "id": "frontend",
      "name": "Frontend Agent",
      "rules": ".prompt-rules/frontend-rules.md",
      "description": "Develops UI interfaces."
    }
  ]
}
```

Include only the agents actually needed for this project. Common agents:
- **backend**: APIs, server logic, database
- **frontend**: UI, components, pages
- **database**: Schema, migrations, seeds
- **auth**: Authentication, authorization
- **devops**: Docker, CI/CD, infrastructure
- **realtime**: WebSocket, streaming
- **testing**: Unit tests, e2e tests

## 📋 OUTPUT FORMAT

For each file, output in this format:

```
### FILE: filename.md
---
[file content]
---
```

For agents.json:
```
### FILE: agents.json
---
{
  "agents": [...]
}
---
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES

1. **Be specific** - Use exact technology names and versions
2. **Be complete** - Cover all aspects of the project
3. **Be practical** - Steps should be actionable
4. **Assign agents** - Every step must have an agent assignment
5. **Define dependencies** - Steps should reference their prerequisites
6. **Estimate time** - Provide realistic time estimates
7. **Create only needed agents** - Don't include agents that won't be used

Now analyze the project idea and generate all 5 files.
